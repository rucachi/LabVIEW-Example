Description:
A couple of Picture datatype hacks to illustrate the structure of the (LV 6.1 - LV 7+ is untested) picture control.

-- Main VIs --

Example - Show How Picture Is Made.vi:
	Main example, shows (incrementally) how a specific picture is generated by displaying the picture with each packet
	incrementally added. Good way to see how your own pictures display information.

Opcodes.csv:
	Comma-delimited file explicitly describing the packet types and their requirements / uses.

Tool - Picture concat.vi:
	Given two pictures, concatenates the data to create a single overlapped picture.

Tool - Packets to Picture.vi:
	Given an array of picture packets (cluster), generates a picture.

Tool - Picture to Packets.vi:
	Given a picture, generates an array of picture packets.

-- Utility subVIs --

sub - 8-Bit string to 32-Bit number.vi:
	utility VI to cast a string to a 32-bit number. Typecast might work instead but this is more explicit.

sub - Find Opcode:
	Given a picture data string that has the size header removed, this will extract an opcode from the front.

sub - Strip top of and check picture.vi:
	Utility VI to strip the header (size) from a picture data string so that it can be scanned for packets.

		- Renamed VIs for clarification of purpose
		- Fixed coercion dots
		- Added 0ms delays in all loops
		- Added error encapsulation in some subvis
		- Replaced local variable for cluster to constant in order to limit thread swapping between the user interface and code threads


1.0.0: (11/07/06)
